	-- this was noticed during SOCKS proxy testing and all outbound connections, regardless of proxychains ip list had the core IP of the redirector as its source port...arg!
	-- because of this, change your /etc/proxychains to "strict_chain"; comment out "random_chain", "chain_len", "proxy_dns"; you only need the core ip set in the list (example, "socks4 1.2.3.4 1080")

- Added protocol and subinterface IP to IPTables rules for more granularity on traffic (re)direction
